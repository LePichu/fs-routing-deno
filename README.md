# Basic FS Routing with Deno and Hono
This is a Demo demonstrating how to use the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) to make a basic SSR (Server Side Rendering) application with Deno and Preact, tho the same technique can be applied to any framework, may or may not require a buildstep.

## How to run
Run `deno run --allow-net --allow-read --unstable server.ts` to start the server, then navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app.
